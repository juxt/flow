= Flow

Flow is a Clojure library that provides Clojure protocols which closely match
with the Java interfaces defined by http://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive
Streams] and standardised as `java.util.concurrent.Flow` in JDK 9 and above.

This interface provides a common standard allowing JUXT libraries to integrate
data streams with back-pressure, and interoperate with other libraries that
support the Reactive Streams standard, such as
https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava].

== Why not just use Reactive Streams JVM interfaces?

The JVM interfaces created by Reactive Streams (Processor, Publisher,
Subscriber, Subscription) are published in the `org.reactivestreams`
http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.3-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/package-summary.html[package]
and in the Java 9 JDK itself, wrapped in the `java.util.concurrent.Flow` class.

Eventually, all compatible JVM libraries are expected to upgrade to the JDK 9
interfaces. However, while Java 8 is still in use, Clojure protocols can be used
to adapt between these Java interfaces and the various library classes that
implement them, allowing a mix of 'old' and 'new' implementations.

== Status

Flow is ALPHA status, meaning that changes are expected.

== Relationship to other Clojure libraries

=== Manifold

Flow plays a similar role to
https://github.com/aleph-io/manifold[Manifold]. Both are written to simplify
programming with asynchronous IO with back-pressure.

=== Ring

Flow is loosely related to https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/issues/393[2.1]

____
(T)he plan is to have NIO protocols that the request body and response body can optionally satisfy.
____

Flow is proposed for consideration as a candidate for these NIO protocols, which
if accepted, would mean the `juxt.flow` namespace prefix could be replaced with
one in the `ring` namespace hierarchy.

=== Flux

https://github.com/juxt/flux[Flux] is a Ring adapter for https://vertx.io/[Vert.x].

The aim is to provide working code examples to demonstrate the sufficiency of
Flow's protocols in implementing various use-cases of async non-blocking IO with
back-pressure using Ring, including streaming request and response bodies,
websockets and server-sent events.
